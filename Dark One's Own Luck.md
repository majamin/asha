Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter 
fate in your favor. W hen you make an ability check or a 
saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d 10 to 
your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but 
before any of the roll’s effects occur.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
