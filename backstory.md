## Story

D'yashama Arƒçiuu [ARCHIEOO] was born into a family that was constantly on the run.
Her heritage, and her mother's tiefling race, constantly led her people to being labelled as heritics and witches.
Her mother, a tiefling warlock worshiping the deceased archdevil Bensozia, was brutally kidnapped and murdered by a batallion of Crusaders, at the command of a particularly cruel captain.
The batallion saw it as an action to strike fear into the Roma encampent, a natural state of war.
Unknown to the troops, the captain had more sinister intentions.
Constantly on the run, her family and community fled from village to village.
Disgusted at the weakness and frailty of her (and her people's) situation, Asha fled in the night sometime before her 17th birthday.
Her father, Robert, following her trail easily, found her sleeping under an elm.
Without waking her, he placed her mother's tome beside her with a note inside.
He knew there would be no convincing her to return with him.
Asha, driven by her experiences, wandered the land in search of power that could give her ultimate control over life and death.
Everywhere she goes, bodies of murderers and rapists hang from trees.
The religious and pious, no matter how good-natured, are not spared.
There is no room in the world for the worship of weak gods.
Seeking to gain more power, Asha made a pact with the Raven Queen.
