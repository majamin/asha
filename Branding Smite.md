Casting Time: Swift
Range: Self
Duration: 1 minute

You can cast this spell when you hit with a melee weapon attack on your turn.

Your weapon gleams with astral radiance as you strike, the light leaping toward your foe, and the attack deals 2d6 extra radiant damage to the target. If the target is invisible, it becomes visible. The target also emits dim light in a 5‚Äêfoot radius and cannot become invisible until the spell ends.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 2nd.
