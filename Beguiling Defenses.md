Beginning at 10th level, your patron teaches you how to 
turn the mind-affecting magic of your enem ies against 
them. You are immune to being charmed, and when 
another creature attempts to charm  you, you can use 
your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on 
that creature. The creature must succeed on a W isdom  
saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or 
be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.
